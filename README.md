ODEC
====

*An Open Digital Evidence Container*

Our life is more and more affected by digital data. But digital data can often be manipulated easily without any traces of the change. To use digital data as part of contracts or in an investigation there is a pressing demand for an easy way to preserve data in a way its integrity and origin is assured.

This project has the goal to implement a tool set for creating, validating, and exploring digital evidence containers.

The concept of the ODEC is based on the following paper:

> Kiertscher, T.; Vielhauer, C.; Leich, M.: _Automated Forensic Fingerprint Analysis: A Novel Generic Process Model and Container Format._ In: Lecture Notes in Computer Science. 2011. Vol 6583/2011. S 262-273. Springer, Heidelberg. DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-19530-3_24. ISBN 978-3-642-19529-7.

A detailed specification of the container format and its process model can be found in [doc/specification.md](doc/specification.md).

A brief manual for the command line interface of the Microsoft .NET / mono based reference implementation `odec.exe` can be found in [src/clr/odec.help.md](src/clr/odec.help.md).
